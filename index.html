<h2 id="Cave-Paintings-Retouched-Liner-Notes-Annotations"><a href="#Cave-Paintings-Retouched-Liner-Notes-Annotations" class="headerlink" title="Cave Paintings, Retouched - Liner Notes &amp; Annotations"></a>Cave Paintings, Retouched - Liner Notes &amp; Annotations</h2><p>This is a short album of minimalist, instrumental guitar music I recorded in 2022. It’s full of hum, hiss, flubs and creaking floorboards. I recently made it more palatable, to my ears, by scooping out the crowded mids and boosting the treble.</p>
<p>The title “Cave Paintings” was originally meant to be a reference to how some still extant tribal peoples regularly touch up ancestral cave paintings and geoglyphs and see it as a  reverent duty rather than disrespectful. I wanted to make an album that could theoretically have other instrumental tracks layered over&#x2F;under it at a later date, perhaps much later, like a cave painting being touched up. I abandoned that idea rather quickly, for technical reasons, <em>and</em> for reasons of inexperience.</p>
<p>So the title should just be interpreted literally, I think. These are the primitive artistic expressions of a person in a cave.</p>
<p>I recorded each track in “The Marvel Method”, in reference to how Jack Kirby would plot and draw a whole Fantastic Four issue and then hand it over to Stan Lee. I would record one track first, usually the rhythm, or what passed for that role, and then play the second track over it, trying to respond, mingle and enhance. I didn’t cut up or paste anything together, each song is just two guitar tracks played start to finish in one performance, each.</p>
<p>Equipment used was about as cheap as you can get. A non-professional USB condenser mic that was the bane of my creative spirit. A 5 watt Monoprice tube amp, with the speaker-out going to the 12” combo speakers of my dead Peavey. A generic Les Paul knockoff that my dad bought from a pawn shop almost thirty years ago that somehow still sounds and feels fantastic. An old version of Audacity for software. That’s it.</p>
<p>As for musical inspiration, the main genres I drew from were the usual suspects: Blues, Folk, Rockabilly, Roma Jazz, Ska, Reggae. What surprised me was how much Metal came through in the end, though. In some cases it was intentional but, mostly, it was not. The shit you listen to when you’re 14 will stick, even if you don’t necessarily want it to.</p>
<h4 id="Remember-Tomorrow"><a href="#Remember-Tomorrow" class="headerlink" title="Remember Tomorrow"></a>Remember Tomorrow</h4><p>I can’t remember any origins of this song, so I probably came up with it in a couple days before settling in to record. Just a bouncy, morning coffee tune that turns wistful. Old times float by, sometimes.</p>
<h4 id="Another-Shore"><a href="#Another-Shore" class="headerlink" title="Another Shore"></a>Another Shore</h4><p>This was also pulled from the aether shortly before recording. I think I intended it to be an extended intro to another song or buildup to a genre shift but never found anything down that path. It’s a song in search of something and sounds it.</p>
<h4 id="Leg-Twist"><a href="#Leg-Twist" class="headerlink" title="Leg Twist"></a>Leg Twist</h4><p>This is a case where the rhythm part was something I’d been jamming for 15-20 years and had never done anything with it until I started recording. Then the lead part was hastily found and assembled in a couple days.</p>
<p>People often glamorize the songwriting and creative process but in my opinion it’s just a damn mess. Trying to catch fish with your bare hands. Schools pass around us constantly and yet each slippery mystery evades our grasp easily.</p>
<h4 id="Night-Sweat"><a href="#Night-Sweat" class="headerlink" title="Night Sweat"></a>Night Sweat</h4><p>This song is about withdrawal. Specifically those times in the middle of the night and you’re stuck in a cycle of being dead tired but you can’t get an hour of sleep before jolting out of bed, dowsed in sweat. You need sleep, but you dread it, so you pace, and you ponder, and you bargain.</p>
<p>This is another one where I had been idly playing the rhythm part for a long time but the song didn’t take shape until I sat down to record and discovered the lead melody. It took a lot of pacing, pondering, and bargaining.</p>
<h4 id="Chained-Together"><a href="#Chained-Together" class="headerlink" title="Chained Together"></a>Chained Together</h4><p>The middle point of the album that mashes together three genres, or attempts at genres. Not much thinking required, here. I just came up with some genre jams and tried to go hard with them.</p>
<h4 id="Serpent-Egg"><a href="#Serpent-Egg" class="headerlink" title="Serpent Egg"></a>Serpent Egg</h4><p>I called this one Serpent Egg because it’s so fucking hissy.</p>
<p><em>j&#x2F;k it’s some dorky jungian shit</em></p>
<p><em>but seriously sorry about the hiss yall</em></p>
<h4 id="Ugly-Duckling"><a href="#Ugly-Duckling" class="headerlink" title="Ugly Duckling"></a>Ugly Duckling</h4><p>This is probably the best guitar I’ve ever played, not just recorded, even with the flubs. Both guitars converse, dance and sing to each other, anima and animus in syzygy. I had the rhythm for over a decade and when I started playing over it for the first time, what arrived felt like it was already there, you know? Ain’t got a positive thing to say about any other track but I brushed up against the Plato zone on this one. Sometimes the planets align. But sometimes you just need a friend to hold up a mirror for you. </p>
<h4 id="Pocket-Watch"><a href="#Pocket-Watch" class="headerlink" title="Pocket Watch"></a>Pocket Watch</h4><p>Just a vibe exercise. Trying to essentially score a scene from an imaginary film. A shady character of some sort, searching for their mark in a crowd anxiously before finally identifying them, making their move, and extricating. </p>
<h4 id="Forgive-Yesterday"><a href="#Forgive-Yesterday" class="headerlink" title="Forgive Yesterday"></a>Forgive Yesterday</h4><p>This song exists entirely to build up to a reprise of the first track, utilizing false starts. </p>
<p>Mission accomplished, soldier. At ease.</p>
<h3 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h3><p>Recording this “album” was extremely frustrating, for many reasons. I loved the discovery process, but hated committing those discoveries to record. Ultimately, though, those discoveries are preserved, in a discrete unit of art that I can consume at my leisure, whenever the need arises. It takes me places and brings me back.</p>
<p>Let it now be consumed by the sea.</p>
